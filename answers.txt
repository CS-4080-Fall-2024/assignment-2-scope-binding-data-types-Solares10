Question # 2 
a.
In the StaticScope class, there are static variables u, v, and w initialized to specific values, 
and a method add(int z) that modifies the static u using v and z. 
The method foo(int x, int w) redefines v locally and passes the add(v) method to bar, 
which creates a local u and runs the function. When foo is called in main, 
it updates the static u based on the initial u, v, and the passed x, and the updated u is printed(Answer-153)

b. 
This code simulates deep binding by using lambdas in Java, where the variable v from the 
calling scope of foo is captured and passed to add, modifying the global variable u. 
The method bar defines a local u that shadows the global one but does not affect the lambda,
which still uses the outer v. After calling foo with u as an argument, the global u is updated, 
and the final value is printed in the main method.(Answer-126)

c.
In this code, the add method modifies the global variable u using locally passed values localU,
localV, and z. The foo method redefines a local v, captures it in a lambda function, and passes 
it to bar, which further calls add with local values. This demonstrates shallow binding, where 
locally defined variables in procedures (foo and bar) are used in the computation instead of 
global variables.(Answer-101)
